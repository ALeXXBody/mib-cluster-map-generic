# mod/custom.sh — one-click install of the "Cluster Map — AA to Virtual Cockpit"
# mod payload (mod/cluster_map_aa_greenmenu/) inside M.I.B.'s Green Engineering
# Menu. NO file on the card or on the unit has to be edited by hand.
#
# How the owner runs it (pure copy-paste flow):
#   1. copy this whole repository's "mod/" folder onto the M.I.B. SD card,
#   2. in the car: hold MENU -> Testmode -> GEM ->
#      M.I.B. -> Advanced Settings -> "Run /mod/custom.sh from m.i.b. SD",
#   3. reboot the unit, open GEM -> the new top-level "ClusterMap" screen is there.
#
# What it does: copies the mod's own screen file (greenmenu/cluster-map.esd)
# into the unit's GEM screen folder (engdefs/) — the same mechanism M.I.B.
# itself uses to register its screens (apps/launcher links
# Launcher-sda0.esd into engdefs/) — then runs the mod's installer from the
# card, so everything is on the unit after this single click.
#
# Idempotent: re-running it just re-copies the screen file and re-runs the
# (already safe) installer. Uninstall stays available in the ClusterMap
# screen itself; it also removes the menu screen again.
#
# NOTE: this file is M.I.B.'s documented hook for user mods ("Run
# /mod/custom.sh from m.i.b. SD"). If another mod you use also ships a
# mod/custom.sh, append its commands below the "ADDON CODE" line instead of
# overwriting this one.
#

# Same environment every M.I.B. GEM screen script gets (see esd/scripts/custom.sh
# in M.I.B.'s own tree).
