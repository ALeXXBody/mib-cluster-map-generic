# navstrip.sh — "Turn info in the info bar" (the strip the Addon's GEM
# calls experimental). Turns the strip that the fork player draws at the
# bottom of the cluster map on or off, in the car, without an install:
#
#   navstrip.sh on | off
#
#   on   the player's live row shows what the hook decoded from the AA
#        navigation channel: the road name | ETA | distance of the next
#        turn, as long as the phone sends them (Android Auto 1.6+).
#   off  the strip goes away; the map covers the whole window again.
#
# How it lands: this writes BOTH halves. (1) the player's own live control
# file /tmp/stream-player.navstrip ("1"/"0": the running player picks it up
# within a second). (2) the settings line GAL_NAV_INFO_STRIP=1, so a
# freshly started player also has the strip on. The player's frame loop
# polls both at most once a second; the hook writes the info file
# (/tmp/gal_nav_info) when its own GAL_NAV_INFO_FILE=1 is set (this switch
# sets that too via the settings file).
#
# The installer writes the two settings switches (GAL_NAV_INFO_STRIP and
# GAL_NAV_INFO_FILE) with their stock "0"; so this switch can turn them
# both off and back on without a re-install.
#
# Exit 0 switched; 3 nothing to change.
