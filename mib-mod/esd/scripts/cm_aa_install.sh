# Fork: install the Android Auto → Virtual Cockpit hook (mib-cluster-map fork)
# from an M.I.B. GEM screen. This does NOT touch persistence bit coding; M.I.B.
# already runs 7 (apps/carp -a) to activate AA/CarPlay/MirrorLink coding.
# Our hook reads the unit's own gal/libautoreceiver, adds a second video sink,
# and pushes the phone's map to the cluster via MOST150.
#
# In M.I.B.'s payload layout the fork lives at mod/cluster_map_aa_greenmenu/
# on the SD card, not at the fork's root: the script below resolves both
# layouts, then runs the fork's enable_hook.sh with the fork's own settings.
